## Project Description

This project demonstrates a classic implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses), focusing on:
- Clean modular code using Python classes
- Terminal-based interaction
- Strong input validation and game state handling
- Scalability for future enhancements (like adding AI)

## Features

-  Two-player gameplay
-  Win and draw detection
-  Automatic switching between players
-  Input validation for invalid or occupied cells
-  Simple text-based UI for easy interaction

##  Code Structure

- **`Player` class**: Represents each player (name and symbol).
- **`Board` class**: Manages the game board, updates cells, checks for wins/draws.
- **`Game` class**: Controls the game loop, player switching, input handling.
